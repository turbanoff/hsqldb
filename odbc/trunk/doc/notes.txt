CURSOR FUNCTIONALITY
Most "cursor" functionality is handled internal in client-side code
that we probably don't need to touch.  The low-leve code works with local
cursor names like "SQL_CUR0x4020d0e0".  For testing with prepared and
non-prepared queries, the string "cursor" (case-insensitive) is not going
over the wire.  There is only one occurrence of a statement with "cursor"
in the driver source code.  convert.c:
        if (SC_is_fetchcursor(stmt))
        {
            sprintf(new_statement, "%sdeclare \"%s\"%s cursor%s for ",
                new_statement, SC_cursor_name(stmt), opt_scroll, opt_hold);
Contrary to the results of my code search, the driver setting
"Use Declare/Fetch" definitely implies that it conditionally issues
DECLARE...CURSOR commands.  Though I may not see it on the wire because
the feature may be off, I should see CURSOR strings in the C code.

SERVER-SIDE PREPARES
Could mean either the EXTENDED mode commands, or the Postresql SQL commands
"PREPARE/EXECUTE/DEALLOCATE".


The win32 build does use the DTS library.

SSPI.  This is for a very proprietary Microsoft SSL service.
But, judging by the ifdefs in connection.c, sspi is require even on the UNIX
client in order to have SSL ability????


ws2_32.dll interceptor may be useful for debugging the Windows driver.
    http://codemagnet.blogspot.com/2007/10/winsock2-replacement.html , but it
    doesn't include the functions I need.


Settings
   Turn USE_SSPI Off!
   Turn NOT_USE_LIBPQ On!  (to disable libpq)
   Disable SSL temporarily until we get it working again, on UNIX use the
    configure "--disable-openssl" switch.
