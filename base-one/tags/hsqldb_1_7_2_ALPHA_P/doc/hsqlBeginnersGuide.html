INTRODUCTION
</a>
This document is written by 
<a href="mailto:blaine.simpson@admc.com">Blaine Simpson</a> of 
<a href="http://admc.com/" target="_top">Axis Data Management Corp</a>.
Distribute freely.
Email me if you have any criticisms, suggestions, corrections, 
additions, etc.
Even if you are only running hsqldb embedded in another product, I
recommend that you work through this document so that you will 
understand hsqldb enough to use it effectively.
This is a <i>Beginner's Guide</i>, so don't expect to find the answers to 
all of your Hsqldb questions here.
See the other docs in $HSQLDB_HOME-- they're really good.
<p>
I believe that everything in this document applies to versions 1.7.x of hsqldb
(unless stated otherwise).
</p><p>
In order to make my examples brief, in most cases I just provide the
UNIX usage.  If you are a Windows user, you may need to change
forward slashes to back-slashes and rework quotes and line-continuations
to satisfy your command shell.
</p><p>
My tact is to avoid hsqldb <i>scripts</i> for the most part, because 
running the Java commands from the command line gives
you a real understanding of how hsqldb works.  For example, if you run
<i>/path/to/runUtil.sh WebServer</i> or
<i>\path\to\runUtil.bat WebServer</i>
you may have no idea that you are actually instantiating a
Java instance of org.hsqldb.WebServer from the hsqldb.jar file.
Assuming that you have a basic understanding of Java, if you run the
Java commands directly, you will know exactly what is happening and 
will gain insights into how you can set up hsqldb for your specific
needs.
(Another reason I am avoiding the scripts is, hsqldb did not have production
quality scripts for Linux before version 1.7.1).
</p><p>
For some commands I show how to specify optional arguments.  When I do, I
use square brackets [like this] around the optional argument(s).  You do
not type the square brackets, and you can omit the entire [expression]
completely.

<a class="heading" name="definitions">
DEFINITIONS
</a>

These definitions are purely stipulative and are made for the purpose
of making this document easy to understand.
</p><p>

<b>dataset identifier</b>
</p><p>
I hereby define "dataset identifier" to be the root filename 
of the database files for any database.  By root filename, I mean the 
part of the database filenames before the . + extension (this is the 
only part of the filename that they all have in common).  The exceptional 
case of a memory-only database has a dataset name of ".", by (my) definition.
</p><p>
<b>$HSQLDB_HOME</b>
</p><p>
The base directory in which hsqldb lives (this is not necessariliy where
your data or databases reside).
</p><p>
<b>NODENAME</b>
</p><p>
A name that your <i>resolver</i> can resolve to an IP address.  This could
be, for example, a hostname, the name of floating IP address,
<i>localhost</i>, or a dotted-quad IP address string like 127.0.0.1.

<a class="heading" name="install">
INSTALLING HSQLDB
</a>
Go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb</a> and click on the <i>files</i> link.
Look over the versions of hsqldb which are listed under the lowercase
heading <b>hsqldb</b>.
Click on the non-bold .zip file link for the version of hsqldb that you want.
(Linux users please see the paragraph following this one).
Extract the zip file to wherever you want the hsqldb system to
reside (the $HSQLDB_HOME).
The contents of production hsqldb archives contain a version-specific
base directory (like <i>hsqldb_v.1.61</i>) as is customary.  However,
at least some non-production archives do not contain a base directory
(i.e., the contents are all <b>relative</b> to an unnamed $HSQLDB_HOME
base directory).
So, after you download the archive, do a <i>unzip -v</i>.
</p><p>
This paragraph is only for Solaris users interested in installing with a
Solaris package.  You have it especially easy.
If you have root privileges on the target server, I 
highly recommend the Solaris package.
Just download the package, do a <i>pkgadd</i>, and you will have a
running database that lives in directory /usr/hsqldb/data/db1, as
soon as you reboot or run <i>/etc/init.d/hsqldb start</i>.
See the file /usr/src/hsqldb/readme.solarispkg for details on how to
add new databases, change the default configuration, etc.
</p><p>
This paragraph is only for Linux users interested in installing with an rpm.
As I write this, a Linux RPM is being built for hsqldb.
Users of Linux versions that support RPMs should look for them at the
same location as the zip files.
Rpms can be installed or upgraded by running <i>rpm -Uvh /path/to/file.rpm</i>
as root.
You can also read about the package before installing it by running <i>rpm -qip /path/to/file.rpm</i>.
You will have to check the download location yourself to see what Java versions,
 Linux versions, etc. are supported by the supplied rpm(s).
</p><p>
Look through $HSQLDB_HOME/readme.txt and/or $HSQLDB_HOME/index.html.  
(They may or may not be there, depending on whether you are working 
with a production release, etc.).
The most important file of the hsqldb system is hsqldb.jar, which
resides at $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar.
Your index.html or readme.txt file should say what version of Java
your hsqldb.jar was built with/for (Rpm users should be able to run
<i>rpm -qi hsqldb</i>, though I can't test that now because the rpm
isn't built yet).
If they don't say, or it is not your JRE version, then I suggest that
you rebuild hsqldb.jar to avoid problems due to JRE version conflicts.
The rest of the section is only for those people who want to rebuild hsqldb.
</p><p>
First set the environmental
variable JAVA_HOME to the base directory of your Java JRE or SDK.
(like "<code>export JAVA_HOME; JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0</code>" in UNIX,
or "<code>set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\J2re1.4.0</code>" in Windows).
(For Solaris, you would normally set JAVA_HOME to /usr/java, which is a sym-link
to the default java home).
</p><p>  You can run run the scripts $HSQLDB/build/switchToJDK*.bat and $HSQLDB/build/buildJDK*.bat
(Windows users, where the * is your Java version number). or the script $HSQLDB/build/buildjar.sh
(no need to specify Java version).
If that works, you're finished with the installation. If
you have any problems with that, then use the following instructions to  perform
the build yourself using Ant. </p>
<p>
If you don't already have Ant, download any recent production version
from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/" target="_top">Apache's Jakarta site</a>,
cd to where you want Ant to live, and extract from the archive with
<i>unzip</i> or <i>tar -xzf</i>.
</p>
<p>
cd to $HSQLDB_HOME/build.  Make sure that the bin directory under your Ant
home is in your search path.
Run the following command.
</p><blockquote><code>ant jar</code></blockquote>
This builds $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar.
<a class="heading" name="architecture">
HSQLDB ARCHITECTURE
</a>

Database files, when there are any, reside in the directory you were in
when you issued the Java command that started the database engine
(starting the Server, or the Tools in the case of Standalone engines).
Four of the files consist of the dataset identifier ("test" is used
as the identifier in this example) and an extension.
Example:
<pre>    test.data
    test.script
    test.properties
    test.backup (in some cases)
    server.properties (in some cases)
    webserver.properties (in some cases)
</pre>
The exception to the claim about the files residing in the startup 
directory is when the dataset identifier consists of a
file path (less the filename extensions), instead of just a base
filename.  For example, <i>/home/databases/test</i> or
<i>C:/TEMP/DBS/test</i> or <i>databases/test</i> instead of just 
<i>test</i>.  In that case,
the directory is determined by the path given.


<a class="heading" name="running">
RUNNING HSQLDB
</a>
Add $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar to your $CLASSPATH.
In perhaps the majority of cases, you will have no pre-existing $CLASSPATH,
and will want only the hsqldb classes and the current directory (in order 
to run your own .class files, etc.) in your classpath.
In this trivial case, the command in UNIX would be
<blockquote><code>export CLASSPATH; CLASSPATH=<span style="color: blue;">$HSQLDB_HOME</span>/lib/hsqldb.jar:.</code></blockquote>
<p>
If you already have a classpath exported (<i>echo $CLASSPATH</i>), then run
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><code>CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:<span style="color: blue;">$HSQLDB_HOME</span>/lib/hsqldb.jar:.</code></blockquote>
(substitute your real <span style="color: blue;">$HSQLDB_HOME</span>, unless you have really set the 
environmental variable.  In the second case, type <i>$CLASSPATH</i> literally).
<p>
<span class="bold">TOOLS</span>
</p><p>
You can use DatabaseManager or QueryTool with any hsqldb database (assuming 
that you can reach it).  (I refer to QueryTool and DatabaseManager below as 
<i>the Tools</i>)
I am writing the Java commands as single long lines because I don't know
how wide your browser window is.  Be aware that your browser may be
folding these single commands into multiple lines (you can check it out
by streteching your browser really wide).
You can, of course, use any shell functionalities to break any given
command into multiple lines.
Don't forget to add $HSQLDB_HOME/lib/hsqldb.jar to your $CLASSPATH as
explained above.
These examples use the sample URL jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://skipper.admc.com.
</p><blockquote>
    <code>java org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager
     ['-?'] [-url jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://skipper.admc.com]</code>
    <p>
      (Don't forget to refresh the tree after data changes).
      IMPORTANT:  Choose your Engine type FIRST, because this will change
      the URL field!

</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <code>java org.hsqldb.util.QueryTool
     ['-?'] [-url jdbc:hsqldb:hsql:] [-test false] [-database //skipper.admc.com]<a href="hsqlBeginnersGuide.html#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>
     </code>
     <p>
      (Loads up a goofy query by default that in most cases has no
       relationship to your data)
      Beware that you need to use "-test false" if you don't want 
       to add test data to your target database.
      The url arg is actually the URL up-to-and-including the last colon.
      The database arg is actually just the last part of the URL, which,
       in the case of Server engines, is not a dataset identifier.
</p></blockquote>
These samples show what I consider to be the most widely useful options--
there are other options too.
Use the '-?' to get a syntax message.  Note that they run in the foreground,
so "&gt; /somewhere 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;" if you want your shell back.
<p>
Default data sources (if you don't give an Applet property of "database"
and do not give a command-line argument).
</p><ul>
    <li>QueryTool defaults to the in-memory database ".".</li>
    <li>DatabaseManager has no default.  It gives you a nice chooser.</li>
</ul>
Specify database with Applet param of ".", arg of -database for QueryTool,
full -url for DatabaseManager (you can't just give the db to DatabaseManager).
<p>

<span class="bold">HSQL Engine Modes</span>
</p><p>
The data source <i>URL</i> is dependent on the Engine Mode, but the
data source <i>Driver</i> is not.  The data source Driver is always
<span class="bold">org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver</span>.

</p><ul>
    <li>
    <span class="bold">In-Memory</span><br>
    URL format:  jdbc:hsqldb:.
    <br>
    No persistence.  An applet, for example, could have his
    very own database running in his memory.  There is no daemon.
    Database uses no network resources.

<div class="red">
	For some reason, with in-memory database ".",
	sometimes you get default
	data and sometimes you don't.  You get the data with QueryTool on the 
	command-line, and with DatabaseManager from Applet.  Otherwise you get
	an empty database.
	file:/path/to.file.html)
</div>
    </li>

    <li>
    <span class="bold">Standalone Engine</span><br>
    URL format:  jdbc:hsqldb:DATASET (where DATASET is the dataset identifier)
    <br>
    Uses files only.  No daemon.
    Just connect with DatabaseManager (or your client code) and it will
    access the files directly.
    Database uses no network resources.
    </li>

    <li>
    <span class="bold">Server Engine</span> and <span class="bold">WebServer Engine</span><br>
    URL format:  jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://NODENAME[:port]  (port defaults to 9001)
    <br>and<br>
    URL format:  jdbc:hsqldb:http://NODENAME[:port]  (port defaults to 80)
    <br>
    Server STARTUP COMMAND:<br>
      <code>java org.hsqldb.Server ['-?'] [-port X] [-database DATASET]</code><a href="hsqlBeginnersGuide.html#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>
    <br>  (where DATASET is the dataset identifier)
    <br>
    WebServer STARTUP COMMAND:<br>
      <code>java org.hsqldb.WebServer ['-?'] [-port X] [-database DATASET]</code><a href="hsqlBeginnersGuide.html#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>
    <br>  (where DATASET is the dataset identifier)
    <p>
    These startup commands show what I consider to be the most widely useful 
    options-- there are other options too.
    Daemon runs in foreground (just like the tools).  Listens to
    port 9001/tcp (80 for Web) by default.  (tools and apps connect up 
    to this)
    Shut down with Interrupt signal, or "shutdown" command with 
    either tool.
    </p><p>
    If you have a new (late model 1.7.2 or later) hsqldb build, and are
    running Java 1.4 or have installed the JSSE extension libraries onto
    Java 1.2 or 1.3, you can run your Server Engine or WebServer Engine
    with TLS (aka SSL) encryption.  
    See the file $HSQLDB_HOME/hsqlSSL.html for how to do that.
    To connect up to a server running with TLS, just use an URL with
    "hsqls://" or
    "https://" instead of "hsql://" or "http://" correspondingly
    (and, like I said, you need a late model hsqldb build, and Java TLS
    capability.  Java requirements are explained in the hsqlSSL.html
    document).
    </p><div class="red">
    IMPORTANT:  With Web/Server engines, the dataset identifier is only
    used by the server daemon to name his data files.  The clients use
    a URL ending in a NODENAME or NODENAME:port to locate the data daemon.
    You can not run more than one dataset on one port.
    </div>

    WebServer-specific stuff.
    The hsqldb WebServer is a lame HTTP/1.0 web server, but for POSTS, 
    instead of posting to a CGI, username + password + statement are passed to 
    DB and executed.  Query results are returned.
    This server is not intended to be used to serve HTML content.
    Unless your DB server is behind a firewall that will not let random tcp
     traffic through (and which does permit http traffic through), just
     run the Server Engine.
    You can give settings in a file named webserver.properties in the 
    directory in which the WebServer will be started up.
    Note that the WebServer engine listens to port 80 by default, and this
    requires superuser privileges.
    So, if you are not root, you will need to change the port by using
    the appropriate argument to <i>java WebServer...</i> or 
    webserver.properteis setting, then use the :port suffix in your
    data source URLs.
    </li>
</ul>

<span class="bold">Database Preparation</span>
If security is of any concern to you at all, then immediately after
starting your database for the first time, you should change the
privileged password in the databse.
Connect up as user "sa" with no password, perhaps using one of the
utilities described above.
Execute the command <span class="italic">set password "newpassword"</span>.
If you will ever make use of non-Admin user account(s), then you should
grant SELECT privilege on the following objects to PUBLIC
<ul>
    <li>system_tables
    </li><li>system_columns
    </li><li>system_indexinfo
    </li><li>system_connectioninfo
</li></ul>
If you don't, then you will have to grant these permissions to every new
user every time you add a new user.
(New users will still be unable to even read data in tables that you
have created, unless you also grant privileges on those objects).
See the <a href="hsqlBeginnersGuide.html#users">section below</a> about using additional database
users.
<p>
    
<span class="bold">Resources</span>
    Do check out the docs in $HSQLDB_HOME/doc.
</p><p>

<a name="footnote"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1</span></a> Note the ambiguity with database arguments between QueryTool and Server.
  QueryTool url arg always ends with : (which is dumb if you ask me), and
  the database starts with / for Servers engines.
  <i>java Server...</i> and <i>java WebServer...</i> database arg is just 
  the dataset identifier, like "test".

<a class="heading" name="flatfiles">
CHARACTER DELIMITED FLAT DATABASE FILES
</a>
For database engines other than In-Memory engines, you can have specific
tables use a text-char-delimited table-specific file to store the data.
</p><p>
Specific <i>tables</i> may be <i>text tables</i>.
You can not change the default mode so that <i>CREATE TABLE</i> commands
will create text tables.
You must use the special <i>CREATE TEXT TABLE</i> command to create a
text table (or use the special SELECT command described below).
</p><blockquote><code>CREATE TEXT TABLE mynewtable...</code></blockquote>
<p>
At this point, the table is read-only and can not store data, because
there is no file associated with the text table.
</p><blockquote><code>SET TABLE mynewtable SOURCE "filename.csv"</code></blockquote>
Now you are all set.
The default delimiter is "<b>,</b>".  You can change that by 
specifying it along with the text file like
<blockquote><code>SET TABLE mynewtable SOURCE "filename.csv;fs=|"</code></blockquote>
where <it>fs</it> means Field Separator.  This and several other useful
settings can be made either with the SET TABLE command or in your 
datasource properties file (like "test.properties").
<p>
To create a new text table from the definition and data of an existing
normal table, use a command like
</p><blockquote><code>
    SELECT * INTO TEXT newtable FROM existingtable
</code></blockquote>
The file name is created automatically (I don't know why the behavior of
the SELECT...INTO command is so radically different from the CREATE command).
The filename is a lower-cased and normalized version of the table name plus
suffix "csv".
The file will reside in the same directory as the other database files.
<p>
To persist changes to your csv file after modifications, use the 
CHECKPOINT command.


<a class="heading" name="users">
ADDITIONAL DATABASE USERS
</a>
There are two classes of database accounts, Admin accounts and non-Admin
accounts.
Admins have privileges to do anything, non-Admins may be granted some
privileges, but may never create or own database objects.
When you first create a hsqldb database, it has only one database user-- SA,
an Admin account, with no password set.
You should set a password (as described above).
You can create as many additional Admin users as you wish.
Each Admin user has a unique user name (and optional password), but 
these accounts are otherwise indistinguishable.
These accounts are created by appending the keyword "ADMIN" to the 
<span class="italic">CREATE USER</span> command (see the Syntax doc).
</p><p>
If you create a user without the ADMIN tag, it will be a Non-Admin account.
These users can not create or own objects, and, by default, they can't use
any database objects.
You should have already granted the permissions listed above in the
database preparation part of the <a href="hsqlBeginnersGuide.html#running">Running hsqldb section</a>.
The user will then be able to perform operations which have been granted to
the pseudo-user PUBLIC.
To give the user additional privileges (even the privilege to read data),
an Admin user must grant those rights to the user (or to PUBLIC).
</p><p>
Since only people with a database account may do anything at all with the 
database, it is often useful to permit other database users to view the 
data in your tables.
To optimize performance, reduce contention, and minimize administration, it
is usually best to grant SELECT to PUBLIC on any object that needs to be
accessed by multiple database users (with the significant exception of any
data which you want to keep secret).
