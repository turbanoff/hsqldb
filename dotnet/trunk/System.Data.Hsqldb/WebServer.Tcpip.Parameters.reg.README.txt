The current HSQLDB Web Server implements only HTTP 1.0 and does not implement
HTTP KEEPALIVE.  As such, a new socket is created, opened and closed for each SQL
statement issued  to the server.

Thus, high traffic is very likely to leave a large number of sockets
continuously in TIME_WAIT, exhausting the number of non TIME_WAIT TCBs
available for reuse.

The included WebServer.Tcpip.Parameters.reg.txt file provides some
registry settings that can be used avoid suprious server failure under the
current Web Server HTTP protocol implementation.

Please note that none of the indicated settings are RFC-compliant.

However, they do allow running the default HSQLDB Database Manager test
script a number of times in short succession against the HSQLDB Web Server
without experiencing failure due to socket (re)allocation errors.

A better approach would be to provide an HTTP 1.1 implementation with
HTTP KEEPALIVE enabled by default.  Work may proceed on this at some
point in the future.

MaxFreeTcbs
********************************************************************************

Determines the number of TCP control blocks (TCBs) the system creates to support
active connections. Because each connection requires a control block, this value
determines how many active connections TCP can support simultaneously. If all
control blocks are used and more connection requests arrive, TCP can prematurely
release connections in the TIME_WAIT state in order to free a control block for
a new connection.

Normally, TCP does not release a connection or reuse its resources until the
connection has remained closed for a period specified by the value of the
TcpTimedWaitDelay entry. This interval is known as the TIME_WAIT or 2MSL (2 x
maximum segment lifetime) state. However, if the system is supporting an
unusually large number of connections and is running short of connection
resources, TCP releases the connection before the value stored in the
TcpTimedWaitDelay entry has expired.

The default value for this entry is determined both by the amount of physical
memory on the computer when TCP/IP starts and by the version of Windows running
on the computer, as shown in the following table.

Amount of physical memory        Windows 2000 Server      Windows 2000 Professional

Less than 19 MB                  500                      250

19–63 MB                         1,000                    500

64 MB or more                    2,000                    1,000

NOTE:

Windows 2000 does not add this entry to the registry. You can add it by
editing the registry or by using a program that edits the registry.

Assuming most server-class machines now have at least 1GB RAM, the following seems
to work well with the other settings to avoid TCB exhuastion:

Decimal 32768 (X 1K/block = 32MB pre-allocated space)

"MaxFreeTcbs"=dword:00008000

********************************************************************************
MaxFreeTWTcbs
********************************************************************************

This parameter controls the number of Transport Control Blocks (TCBs) in the
TIME-WAIT state that are allowed on the TIME-WAIT state list. Once this number
is exceeded, the oldest TCB will be scavenged from the list. In order to maintain
connections in the TIME-WAIT state for at least 60 seconds, this value should
be >= (60 * (the rate of graceful connection closures per second) for the
computer. The default value is adequate for most cases.

We set this equal to MaxFreeTcbs so that we don't scavenge until we reach a state
where all TCBs have been used, closed and are still in TIME_WAIT.  The likelyhood
of this happening is very low, given the other settings

Decimal 32768

"MaxFreeTWTcbs"=dword:00008000

********************************************************************************
TcpTimedWaitDelay
********************************************************************************

Determines the time that must elapse before TCP can release a closed
connection and reuse its resources. This interval between closure and
release is known as the TIME_WAIT state or 2MSL state. During this
time, the connection can be reopened at much less cost to the client
and server than establishing a new connection.

RFC 793 requires that TCP maintains a closed connection for an interval
at least equal to twice the maximum segment lifetime (2MSL) of the network.
When a connection is released, its socket pair and TCP control block (TCB)
can be used to support another connection. By default, the MSL is defined
to be 120 seconds, and the value of this entry is equal to two MSLs, or
4 minutes. However, you can use this entry to customize the interval.

Reducing the value of this entry allows TCP to release closed connections
faster, providing more resources for new connections. However, if the
value is too low, TCP might release connection resources before the
connection is complete, requiring the server to use additional resources
to reestablish the connection.

Note

Normally, TCP does not release closed connections until the value of this
entry expires. However, TCP can release connections before this value expires
if it is running out of TCP control blocks (TCBs). The number of TCBs the
system creates is specified by the value of the MaxFreeTcbs entry.

Windows 2000 does not add this entry to the registry. You can add it by
editing the registry or by using a program that edits the registry.

We use a conservative twice the minimum:  60 seconds

"TcpTimedWaitDelay"=dword:0000003C

********************************************************************************
MaxUserPort
********************************************************************************

Determines the highest port number TCP can assign when an application requests
an available user port from the system. Typically, ephemeral ports (those used
briefly for wild-card binds) are allocated to port numbers 1024 through 5000.


NOTE

Setting MaxUserPort higher than the default (or installing a service
whose well-known, i.e. registered with IANA, port lies in the range 1025
- MaxUserPort), may require setting up port reservation to avoid bind
exceptions.

Microsoft SQL Server, for instance, reserves the range 1433-1434 during
installation.

Port reservation allows an application to prevent a range of ports from being
assigned during a wildcard bind. However, reserving a port range does not
prevent an application from performing a specific bind (a request for the use
of a specific port) within a reserved range. When reserving a port range, you
must choose a contiguous range of port numbers from 1025 to the value of the
MaxUserPort setting (5000 by default) or from 49152 to 65535. Multiple client
applications can reserve the same range. When unreserving (removing the
reservation), Windows Sockets removes the first entry it finds that is
completely encompassed by the unreserve request.

You can also specify a range of reserved ports with the registry by doing
the following:

1.
 Click Start, click Run, type regedit.exe, and then click OK.

2.
 Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters

3.
 On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click Multi-string Value.

4.
 Type ReservedPorts and then press ENTER.

5.
 Double-click the ReservedPorts value, type the range of ports using the
 syntax: x-y

 To specify a single port, use the same value for x and y. For example,
 to specify port 4000, type 4000-4000.

6.
 Click OK.

7.
 Quit Registry Editor


Note

Windows 2000 does not add this entry to the registry. You can add it by editing
the registry or by using a program that edits the registry.

Decimal 16000 (ports from 1025 to 7999)

"MaxUserPort"=dword:00001f3f

********************************************************************************
MaxHashTableSize
********************************************************************************

Determines the size of the hash table in which TCP control blocks
(TCBs) are stored.

TCP stores control blocks in a hash table so it can find them very
quickly. If you adjust the number of TCBs the system creates (as
specified by the value of the MaxFreeTcbs entry), you should also
adjust the value of this entry proportionately.

Note

The value of this entry must be a power of two. If you change the
value, the system rounds the value you enter to the next higher
power of two.

Windows does not add this entry to the registry. You can add it by
editing the registry or by using a program that edits the registry.

Decimal 16384 seems to work fine with MaxFreeTcbs specified
earlier in this document.

"MaxHashTableSize"=dword:00004000
