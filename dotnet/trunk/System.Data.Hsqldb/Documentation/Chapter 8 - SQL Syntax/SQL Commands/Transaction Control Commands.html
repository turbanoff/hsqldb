                Note</h3>
            <p>
                With the exception of writing SQL scripts, the <tt>COMMIT</tt>, <tt>RELEASE SAVEPOINT</tt>,
                <tt>ROLLBACK</tt>, <tt>SAVEPOINT</tt> and <tt>SET AUTOCOMMIT</tt> commands should
                <em>never</em> be used directly.</p>
            <p>
            To maintain ADO.NET code portability and to allow participation in
                ADO.NET distributed transactions, the
                <see cref="System.Data.IDbConnection.BeginTransaction()">
                BeginTransaction()</see>
                method should be used to start each new transaction and the resulting
                <see cref="System.Data.IDbTransaction">IDbTransaction</see>
                object should be used to commit or roll back the work. In order to create, release,
                and roll back named save points, it is necessary to cast the resulting <tt>IDbTransaction</tt>
                object to an
                <see cref="System.Data.Hsqldb.Client.HsqlTransaction">HsqlDbTransaction</see>

        <p>
            <tt>0</tt> is interpreted as no limit; it disables automatic checkpoints based on transaction log growth.</p>
        <h3>
            <a name="set_write_delay-section"></a>SET WRITE DELAY</h3>
        <pre lang="sql">SET WRITE_DELAY {{ TRUE | FALSE } | &lt;seconds&gt; | &lt;milliseconds&gt; MILLIS};
        </pre>
        <p style="color: Orange">
            <strong>Requires administrative privileges</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            Controls the frequency at which the transaction log is sync'ed to disk.</p>
        <p>
            When <tt>WRITE_DELAY</tt>
            is set to <tt>FALSE</tt> or <tt>0</tt>, a file sync takes place immediately
            at each explicit or implicit <tt>COMMIT</tt>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            When <tt>WRITE_DELAY</tt> is set <tt>TRUE</tt> (the default) a file sync takes
            place once
            every 20 seconds</p>
        <p>
            Numeric values are interpreted in seconds unless the MILLIS option is specified also, in which case values are interpreted in milliseconds.</p>
        <p>
            It is possible to specify a numeric value as low as 10 MILLIS.&nbsp; Lower values
            are silently adjusted back to 10 MILLIS.</p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this command is to control the tradeoff between maximum transaction
            rate and maximum data loss in case of abnormal terminiation.</p>
        <p>
            For a given setting, data commited in the last write delay period
            before abnormal
            termination may not be recoverable. Data commited prior to this is guaranteed
            to be recoverable, as long as the target disk sub-system and operating system
            both live up to the advertised contract for the file sync system call.</p>
        <p>
            In practice,
            a write delay of 100 milliseconds provides better than 99.9999% reliability
            with an average one system crash per day, or 99.99999% with an average one system
            crash per 6 days.</p>
        <p>
            A write delay of FALSE or 0 impacts performance in high load situations, as the engine
            has to wait for the file system to catch up.&nbsp; In general, modern systems
            exhibit a 5-15 millisecond latency for file sync calls, limiting the maximum
            transaction rate to between 60 to 200 per second.&nbsp; I practice, setting
            write delay to FALSE or 0 yeilds a much lower actual rate than the theoretical maximim
            imposed by the average file sync latency of the system in question.</p>
        <p>
            Each time a <tt>SET WRITE_DELAY</tt> is issued with any value, a sync is immediately
            performed.</p>
